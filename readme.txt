================================================================
                Controls - Molar Mass Calculator           [co5]
================================================================

When entering formula:
----------------------

[Enter] - Evaluate molar mass of inputted molecule.
[Alpha] - Switch between numerical, uppercase and lowercase mode
[Mode]  - Return to calculator menu.
[Clear] - Clear entire query, or return to calculator menu if 
          query is empty.
[Del]   - Deletes one character.
[Left]  - Deletes one character.

Clicking alpha-numerical keys inputs characters to the query
depending on which mode is activated, indicated by the flashing
cursor. A vertical bar indicates uppercase mode, a downwards
arrow indicates lowercase mode, and a horizontal bar indicates
numerical mode. The mass calculator is case-sensitive, so be
sure to input the formula correctly and switch between the 
different modes appropriately. For example, Co (Colbalt) has a 
mass of 58.9332 g/mol, whereas CO (Carbon Monoxide) has a mass
of 28.0101 g/mol. 

In addition to the alpha-numerical keys, you can also enter
parentheses when the numerical mode is set. The molar mass 
calculator supports nested parenthesis. 

After evaluating formula:
-------------------------

[2nd]   - Clears first formula and allows you to enter another
          formula.
[Enter] - Clears first formula and allows you to enter another
          formula.

[2nd]   - Toggle between alphabetical and list mode.
[Mode]  - Return to property selection menu.
[Clear] - Clear entire query, or return to property selection
          menu if query is empty.
[Del]   - Deletes single character. 

The list prompt makes use of two modes - alphabetical and list.
In alphabetical mode, you can export data to custom lists; for
example, LMMASS or LATRAD. In list mode, you can export data
to the 6 pre-existing lists (L1 - L6). You can only toggle
between the two modes when the query is empty. 

If the list you specify already exists, the program will ask
whether you want to overwrite the list. Clicking [Y] will cause
the program to proceed to export the data, and clicking [N] will
bring the program back to the list name prompt.

================================================================
                     Molar Mass Calculator                 [op1]
================================================================

The molar mass calculator uses the atomic weight data to 
calculate the mass of molecules. It is accessed through the
options menu; more specifically, by pressing, from the main 
periodic table, [X,T,*,n] -> [2] -> [Enter], or alternatively,
[+] -> [Enter]. 

To use the calculator, press the alphabetical keys on the 
calculator to input the symbol of the first element of the 
molecule. If the length of the symbol is 2 or 3 characters long,
input the 2nd and 3rd letters of the symbol using the lowercase 
mode, activated by pressing [Alpha] until the cursor turns into 
a down-pointing arrow. If the element has a subscript, switch
to numerical mode by pressing [Alpha] until the cursor turns 
into a horizontal line, then enter the subscript. For more 
details on using the molar mass calculator, see the controls
section at [co5]. 

If you input a non-existent element, the calclator will throw
the error message "[x] not recognized", whereas [x] is the
non-existent element. Unlike the 83+/84+ calculators, the 
calculator can only process formulas with closed parentheses.
If the formula you input contains an unclosed parenthesis, the 
calculator will display the message "Missing ')'". Click any 
button to close the error message and return to editing the 
formula.

The calculator supports nested parenthesis, meaning it can
evaluate formulas like (Al2(SO4)3)2. It also supports decimal
subscripts, for formulas like YBa2Cu3O6.5.

I haven't figured out the exact limitations of the calculator,
but just try not to input either an absurdly large formula or
a formula with an enormous mass.

================================================================
            Electronegativity Difference Calculator        [op2]
================================================================

The electronegativity difference calculator uses the 
electronegativity data to determine quantities such as the
polarity of bonds between two elements. The calculator is found
in the calculators section of the options menu. Press [X,T,*n]
-> [2] -> [2] or use the shortcut [+] -> [2] from the main
periodic table to reach this calculator. 

Once opened, the calculator will prompt for two elements. Use
the alphabetical keys of the calculator to input the symbols
for both elements. The calculator will automatically switch 
between uppercase and lowercase forms, so no manual adjustment 
is necessary. For more information, look at section [co6].

If the calculator does not recognize the element inputted, it
will display the error message "Element not found". You will
then be able to edit the symbol again.

Once both elements have been entered, the calculator will
determine the electronegativity difference, predicted bond type,
and the percent ionic character. The bond type is predicted
using the following algorithm: 

If the electroneg diff is < .4, then nonpolar
If the electroneg diff is > 1.7, then ionic
Else, polar.

Keep in mind that since no systematic thresholds actually exist,
the calculator can only estimate the bond type. 

The calculator also determines the percent ionic character
using the formula:

% Ionic Char = (1 - e^((-1/4)*(Xa - Xb)^2)) * 100%

where Xa - Xb is the electronegativity difference.

Afterwards, you will have the option to enter a second pair of
elements, return to the main menu, or store the calculated
difference. Again, see [co6] for a more comprehensive overview
of the controls. 

================================================================
                            Export                         [op3]
================================================================

The export function allows you to export data to TI lists, where
you can manipulate/study them outside of the Eclectic program.
To access the export menu, press [X,T,*,n] -> [3], or [Stat]
from the main periodic table.

The export property menu presents all the different data that 
you can export. Currently, all of the numerical data except for
the conductivity data can be exported. Navigate the property
menu using the D-pad and shortcut keys (see [co7] for more
information on controls). 

Once you choose a property, the program will prompt you to 
input the name of the list you wish to export to. You can 
specify either custom lists, for example "HVAP", or use the
TI lists L1 - L6. In accordance to the format of TI lists,
custom names cannot be more than five characters in length.

If there is not enough RAM on the calculator to successfully
export the data, the program will display "Not enough memory".
The program will then abort the exporting process. In this case,
in order to successfully export the data, you must clear some
of your calculator's RAM by archiving or deleting data.

================================================================
                            Grapher                        [op4]
================================================================

The grapher function allows you to graph element properties by
atomic number, and observe trends in the periodic table. To 
reach the grapher menu, press [X,T,*,n] -> [4], or [Vars] from
the main periodic table.

The graph property menu works in the same way as the export 
property menu, so check [op3] above for details on that menu.
Also, check [co8] for information on the controls of the grapher
menu.

Once you choose a property, the program will pause for a moment
to draw the data points and the graph GUI. Then, you will be
able to view the graph for the property you selected. From the
graph viewing screen, you can move from element to element using
the right/left controls, jump to a different element by pressing
[Trace] or view the axes using [Y=]. See [co8] for a more
detailed overview.

NOTE: The [Window] and [Zoom] functions do not work as they
are currently being debugged, and may be functional in 
subsequent versions of Eclectic. 

In addition, you can change the graph style in the preference
menu, which can be found by pressing [X,T,*,n] -> [5]. The three
different graph styles are dot, line and bar. The dot style,
which is default, will cause the grapher to draw a single point
as the data point. The line style will cause the grapher to 
draw lines between consecutive points. The bar style will cause
the grapher to fill in the space under the points with black
bars. 

Eclectic saves your graph style preference in the VECLECT 
AppVar, which has a size of only 20 bytes. In the case that 
Eclectic cannot unarchive the appvar, it will display the 
message "Can't unarc. settings AppVar" when the program boots
up. In this case, the program will resort to the default 
settings.
